# Introduction

## What?

A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable security tool designed to attract attackers and record the actions of 
adversaries.

## Why?

Honeypots can be used in a defensive role to alert administrators of potential breaches and to distract attackers 
away from real infrastructure. Honeypots are also used to collect data on the tools and techniques of adversaries 
and assist with generating effective defensive measures.
