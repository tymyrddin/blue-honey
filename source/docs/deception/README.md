# Introduction

## What?

Use deception technology, populating the environment with decoys: fake endpoints, files, services, databases, users, 
computers, and other resources that mimic assets.

## Why?

To lure adversaries away from legitimate targets and detect intruders in the early stages of an attack, both key to 
minimising damage.

## How?

Most of these open source honeypots can be set up in a lab in a weekend, including T-pot. Then use red-team tactics 
to learn what kind of telemetry you might get from the different honeypots. 

* [Clients](clients.md)
* [Databases](databases.md)
* [ICS/SCADA](ics.md)
* [Emails](emails.md)
* [Network services](network.md)
* [Web applications](webapps.md)
* [T-Pot framework](tpot.md)

If you manage to fingerprint any of the honeypots, make sure to let the creators know.
