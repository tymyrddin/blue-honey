# Introduction

## What?

Deploying some known often-used honeypots.

## Why?

Most of the open source honeypot dockers can be set up in a lab in a weekend, including T-pot, and can then be used to learn what kind of telemetry one might get from the different honeypots. 

**If you manage to fingerprint any of the used honeypots, make sure to let the creators know.**
