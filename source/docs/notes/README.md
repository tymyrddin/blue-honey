# Introduction

## What?

Choices developers, system administrators, researchers, and threat hunters face:

1. What type of honeypot?
2. Which IDS to integrate with?
3. What kind of attacks to capture?
4. What vulnerability to emit?
5. How hard must it be to detect it?

## Why?

Wrong design decisions may result in collecting irrelevant information or even exposing the deception technology itself.
