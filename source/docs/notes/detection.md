# Detecting honeypots

Honeypot detection lies in an attacker's ability to detect and find out about the deceptive nature of the honeypot. Often this relies on the limited ability of a honeypot to align with an attacker's mental model based on the attacker's expectation of what a realistic environment should look like.

There are also additional design constraints for honeypots that attackers are aware of. There are legal constraints that prevent realistic emulations. Such constraints are due to the nature of defenders having to abide by the law and as such attacker's knowingly look for signs of such legal constraints (for example, a honeypot bot that is part of a botnet cannot legally perform denial of service attacks to systems).
