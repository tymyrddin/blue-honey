# Shiva

[SHIVA Spampot](https://github.com/shiva-spampot/shiva) is a Spam Honeypot with Intelligent Virtual Analyzer, an open 
but controlled relay Spam Honeypot (SpamPot). 

"SHIVA was initially developed during 2012/2013 and used the Lamson framework in the background. However, due to lack 
of time, the project was not updated regularly. The old code was complicated and had a lot of monkey-patching which 
made it harder to maintain. Current efforts will focus on simplifying the codebase, and adding features like easy 
deployment via Docker, better documentation, Elasticsearch integration for search/analysis, threat intel service 
lookups, updated OSS licence, etc."
