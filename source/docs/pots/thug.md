# Thug

[Thug](https://github.com/buffer/thug) is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicking the behaviour of a 
web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious contents.

The number of client-side attacks has grown significantly in the past few years shifting focus on poorly protected 
vulnerable clients. Just as the most known honeypot technologies enable research into server-side attacks, 
honeyed clients allow the study of client-side attacks.

A complement to honeypots, a honeyclient is a tool designed to mimic the behaviour of a user-driven network client 
application, such as a web browser, and be exploited by an attacker's content.
