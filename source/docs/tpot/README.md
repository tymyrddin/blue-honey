# Introduction

## What?

[T-Pot](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce) is an All-In-One Multi Honeypot Platform, supporting 20+ 
honeypots and countless visualisation options using the Elastic Stack, animated live attack maps and lots of 
security tools to further improve the deception experience.

## Why?

Most of the open source honeypot dockers can be set up in a lab in a weekend, including T-pot, and can then be used in  
red-team tactics to learn what kind of telemetry one might get from the different honeypots. 

**If you manage to fingerprint any of the used honeypots, make sure to let the creators know.**
