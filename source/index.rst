Threat landscape
===========================================

The threat landscape for people in the public and private sector has changed enormously over the past decade. Physical
threats have decreased while digital security threats have increased. Meanwhile the vulnerabilities of organisations
have grown due to BYOD policies for communications, distributed teams, and public cloud-based applications being used
in normal workflows.

These are resources for gathering, organising, analysing, and refining information about attacks, so they can
be learned from to protect people and organisations better.
